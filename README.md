ABOUT:

Syntactical is a desktop application that allows you to practice, learn, compare code using a variety of languages such as C, C++, Java, Python. Whether you’re a beginner programmer or expert with many years of experience, the art of using multiple languages in a day to day basis can be a bit of a challenge. Syntactical accepts that challenge and delivers a “Learn with what you already know” approach, with its built in side by side data pads  and compiler you can quickly learn the similarities between your own native language that your well experienced in and that of the language you're quickly learning.  Whether you’re coming from low-level C to high end Python or vise versa, you’ll quickly learn by comparing syntactical differences in your code to accomplish the task.
